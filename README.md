## Warning

You should not use this code. No seriously, you don't want something like this. The code below is an exercice to introduce students to WPdev. This is a simple introduction.

## Synopsis

miniTumblr is a tiny reader of tumblr feed. You add the name of a tumblr than click the button to display the content of the tumblr. miniTumblr shows the title and the first picture of each post.

## Motivation

When I started WPdev, I read a [great tutorial](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davrous/archive/2010/03/18/mini-tutorial-windows-phone-7-recr-ez-en-silverlight-le-mini-client-twitter-de-scott-guthrie-du-mix2010.aspx) from David Rousset. miniTumblr is a forked of his code (the original code was made by Scott. The goal was to build a small reader for Twitter. Since 2010, the Twitter API change a lot. The application was broken. I could not share the tutorial. I was bother so I made this one.
